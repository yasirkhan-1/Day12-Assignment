What is SQL?  
o Write a brief explanation of SQL and its purpose in web development.
ANSWER:
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardized programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It allows users to store, retrieve, update, and delete data efficiently.

ðŸ”¹ Purpose in Web Development:
In web development, SQL is used to interact with the backend database of a website or web application. Here's how it helps:

Storing user data (e.g., login info, form submissions)

Fetching dynamic content for display (e.g., product listings, search results)

Updating data based on user interactions (e.g., editing profiles, adding items to a cart)

Maintaining data integrity and security

Example:
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'test@example.com';


This SQL query retrieves all data for the user with the specified email â€” a common operation in login systems.

In short, SQL connects the front end of a website with the data stored on the back end, making websites interactive andÂ data-driven.
